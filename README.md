## Project Title:
Classification With Coral

## Project Description:
Our project will assess whether physical hardware access gives advantages machine learning applications as opposed to cloud based machine learning tools.
We will accomplish this by performing image classification on the Google Coral TPU Dev Board Micro with varying ML models. Then we will perform image analysis using Google Colab CPU and TPU with those same ML models. Finally we will compare results between the two platforms and draw a conclusion on the advantages of physical hardware for machine learning.

## Key Objectives:
Perform image classification on Google Coral Dev Board Micro 
Gather performance statistics using various ML models on the Coral Micro
Perform image classification on Google Colab with CPU and TPU
Compare results between platforms


## Technology Stack:
Google Coral TPU Dev Board Micro 
C++/C Programming Languages
FreeRTOS
VirtualBox (Ubuntu machine necessary)
Google Colab

## Expected Outcomes:
We will determine the efficacy of the Google Coral TPU Dev Board Micro at classifying images using varying ML models.

We will optimize the performance of the Google Coral TPU Dev Board Micro.

We will compare the performance of the Google Coral board with the performance of Google Colab to determine if having access to physical hardware has advantages over cloud based machine leanring. 

## Timeline:
Week 1 - Configure board

Week 2 - Perform image classification

Week 3 - Compare results from both platforms

Week 4 - Finish report and verify results
